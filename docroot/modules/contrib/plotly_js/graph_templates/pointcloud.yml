  description: Sets the x coordinates.
- fieldname: y
  title: Y Values

# We don't use XY because it requires additional datatype casting and you can just
#   use the x and y settings individually for the same result
#- fieldname: xy
#  values: data array
#  description: Faster alternative to specifying `x` and `y` separately. If supplied,
#    it must be a typed `Float32Array` array that represents points such that `xy{i

        on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated
        by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't
        available on the system. The plotly service (at https://plot.ly or on-premise)
        generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed
        and supported. These include `Arial`, `Balto`, `Courier New`, `Droid Sans`,,

      if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate
      to `namelength - 3` characters and add an ellipsis.

  - fieldname: namelengthsrc
- fieldname: indices
  title: Indices
  values: data array
  description: A sequential value, 0..n, supply it to avoid creating this array inside
    plotting. If specified, it must be a typed `Int32Array` array. Its length must
    be equal to or greater than the number of points. For the best performance and
    memory use, create one large `indices` typed array that is guaranteed to be at
    least as long as the largest number of points during use, and reuse it on each
    `Plotly.restyle()` call.
- fieldname: xbounds
  title: Xbounds
  values: data array

- fieldname: marker
  title: Marker
  subfields:
  - fieldname: color
    title: Color
    values: color
    description: Sets the marker fill color. It accepts a specific color.If the color
      is not fully opaque and there are hundreds of thousandsof points, it may cause
      slower zooming and panning.
  - fieldname: opacity
    title: Opacity
    values: number
    min: 0
    max: 1
    default: 1
    description: Sets the marker opacity. The default value is `1` (fully opaque).
      If the markers are not fully opaque and there are hundreds of thousands of points,
      it may cause slower zooming and panning. Opacity fades the color even if `blend`
      is left on `false` even if there is no translucency effect in that case.
  - fieldname: blend
    title: Blend
    values: boolean
    description: Determines if colors are blended together for a translucency effect
      in case `opacity` is specified as a value less then `1`. Setting `blend` to
      `true` reduces zoom/pan speed if used with large numbers of points.

      title: Color
      values: color
      description: Sets the stroke color. It accepts a specific color. If the color
