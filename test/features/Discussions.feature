Feature: Create A Forum (Discussion) And Add Comments To The Topics/Thread
  As a site builder, I can create forums/discussions that allow users to interact with others to share information about datasets,
  tools, or other topics in the catalog so that knowledge is shared across the agency.
  An authenticated user can create new topic/thread and also can comment on any topics posted in the forum.
  A Site Visitor can view all existing discussions.
  A site user can discover forums related to different content types.
